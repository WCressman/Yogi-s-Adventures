Welcome to Yogi's Adventures!

A simple grid based game where you move around your character (Yogi) and interact with random events you find
amongst the squares until you clear the whole map or you inevitably die...

Movement: Arrow Keys
Show Stats: S
Return to Map: Q

If you clear the whole grid, you win.
If your health reaches 0, you lose.

The currency in the game is "Fame", ultimately the goal is to clear the map without dying whilst getting the most amount of fame.

(Note that the game does not have any actions the player can truly control to change their outcome, in other words it is totally random, the game is more a proof of concept)

There are 5 distinct interactions:
- Treasure: Grants 10 Fame
- Small Potion: Grants 10 HP
- Potion: Grants 20 HP
- Toxic Potion: Removes 15 HP
- Monsters: Deal 20, Grant 10 Fame if Slain

Tiles you have previously walked upon are marked.
You can customize the grid size on line 181, affecting a new value to the variable "tile_size"
